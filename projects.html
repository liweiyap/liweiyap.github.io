        <p>I developed a mobile app for automating night-time narration in the social-deduction board games <i>The Resistance: Avalon</i> and <i>Secret Hitler</i> using the <a href="https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer"><i>ExoPlayer</i></a> library. I synthesized the speech audio files for the narration via the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text‐to‐Speech API</a> from the Google Cloud SDK using Bash scripting.</p>
        {% include narradir-carousel.html %}
        This app offers the following improvements over similar apps out there:
        <ul>
            <li>It allows the user to play a background sound during narration to help cover up any sounds made inadvertently by players.</li>
            <li>It allows the user to change the pause length during which certain characters have to perform their roles.</li>
            <li>In the case of <i>The Resistance: Avalon</i>, it provides a "smart" selection for the characters. As the number of players changes, the range of characters available for selection might also change. In addition, certain selection rules apply. Some characters will be automatically selected/deselected depending on the selection/deselection of other characters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="post-subtitle">MacOS menu bar app in SwiftUI for language learners</h3>
        <p>I used to live in Switzerland, and I do not wish to lose my German. Hence, I used the Python library <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/"><i>Beautiful Soup</i></a> to scrape a list of German idioms/expressions, as well as their respective meaning and history, from <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_deutscher_Redewendungen">Wikipedia</a>, storing them in an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database.</p>
        <p>I then used the SwiftUI framework to create a desktop application that pops up at user-specified intervals, each time with a random expression from the SQLite database. These pop-ups serve as virtual placards for my regular revision of German expressions.</p>
        {% include text-popover-carousel.html %}
        <p>The user can also open the settings window and create new databases, so that the pop-up can display other user-defined texts:</p>

        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Android app in Java</h3>
        <p>I developed a simple mobile app to browse <a href="https://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a> comic strips. The JSON data of every strip is retrieved from the XKCD website using the <a href="https://github.com/google/volley"><i>Volley</i></a> library. The user can zoom in and out of the displayed comic strip, display the artist's personal description of the comic strip via a long press, navigate to a different comic strip number, and even save the displayed comic strip to the Photo Gallery.</p>

        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Web scraping in Python</h3>
        <p>As I was interested in comparing the number of commits I myself have made to the respective default branch (usually <code>master</code> or <code>main</code>) of my personal repositories, I scraped the necessary data from the GitHub <a href="https://api.github.com/">API</a> using Python, and then sorted and organised the data into a <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas"><i>Pandas</i></a> dataframe.</p>

        <p>Given a grid of cells, each cell has an initial state: <i>live</i> (1) or <i>dead</i> (0). Each cell interacts with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood">eight neighbours</a> (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) using the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules">four rules</a>:</p>

            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population <i>(scarce nutrients)</i>.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction <i>(ideal population density)</i>.</li>
