        <p>I develop the company's internal native Android app in Java and C++ for controlling a remote audio device.</p>
        <p>I also develop parts of the real-time C++17 codebase on Linux for quaternion detection and for data serialisation with <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/" tabindex="0">FlatBuffers</a>. Besides, I am involved in package management in Python.</p>
        <p>My work was showcased in demos that won the start-up <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/business/edinburgh-firm-behind-revolutionary-rapid-hearing-test-gears-market-launch-3008848" tabindex="0">Â£715,000</a> in funding.</p>
